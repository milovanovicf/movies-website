About "Movies you might like"

A website that creates daily lists about movies and shows to help you find a movie/show that you were searching for for so long. 
This is just a way for me(a new wannabe web developer) to learn and practise coding and maybe one day get an actual job.
The website is unfinished and requires a lot more work and work requires time which i dont have at the moment so please dont judge it too harshly. 
I am planning to add some new features in the future and also make other pages so that half of the page doesnt lead to anything anymore. 
Also add some new functions and a bit more style and a verson for smaller screens or moblile verson and maybe one day build an actual community of people who has the same passion about movies as i do or just regular people who want to find a movie to watch.
Cheers! :)
